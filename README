			   oin17 -- A CS coins miner


    oin17 is the miner used, by the "Toaster Tech Laboratories" team of the
    Université du Québec à Montréal, to win the CS Coins challenge of the
    2017 edition of the CS Games[1]. Since the competition is over, we
    thought we would share the miner's source code with the public.


PREPARING FOR THE EVENT

    Obviously, this program was written for the specific purpose of the
    competition. As competitors were a bit left in the dark on how the challenge
    would take place, we had to prepare a lot more than was necessary in order
    to be in the best possible position right at the beginning.

    We knew we would be able to install libraries and tools, and that the system
    would be Linux-based. Not knowing which distribution would be available, we
    decided to bring some of our dependencies to make sure we would not be set
    back by incompatibilities. These dependencies can be found in 3rd/.

    We doubted miners would coexist in the same space so assumed we would either
    run in a VM (where we would have full control) or in a container (so it
    would be lower in resources requirements). For the first case, we prepared a
    VM image-building script. For the second case, we prepared a Dockerfile.
    Additionally, we prepared for fast "adapt and reload" cycles by writing
    deployment automation scripts.


DURING THE EVENT

LICENSE

    This project cannot be distributed at the moment.


BUILDING

    To build oin17, the following tools are needed:

        - a modern, C99-compliant, compiler;
        - the make utility;
        - CMake;
        - OpenSSL version 1.1.0;
        - A recent enough zlib or libz.


DEVELOPMENT

    Setup your own CA server. There is a script in tools/ available to
    facilitate the process.
